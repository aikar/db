# IDB - Intuitive Database Wrapper

This is my JDBC Database Wrapper, with the intent on providing a clean intuitive API, for access to a JDBC database,

IDB handles connections, query, execution, result fetching and data return for all the common access operations without the boilerplate of making all of the JDBC API's yourself.

Most Database operations can be completed in a single API call.

Built currently on top of Hikari Connection Pool.

Get off your dinosaur and get on this rocket ship!

Dinosaurs have been dead for a long time, so get off it before you start to smell.
